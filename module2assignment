                        it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, 
                        from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western 
                        India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about
                         43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. 
                        Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern. </p></td>

                    <td> <p><u>The cheetah</u><br>The cheetah lives in three main social groups: females and their cubs, male "coalitions", and solitary males. While females
                         lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home ranges, males are more sedentary and instead establish much smaller 
                         territories in areas with plentiful prey and access to females. The cheetah is active during the day, with peaks during dawn
                          and dusk. It feeds on small- to medium-sized prey, mostly weighing under 40 kg (88 lb), and prefers medium-sized ungulates 
                          such as impala, springbok and Thomson's gazelles. The cheetah typically stalks its prey within 60–100 m (200–330 ft) before 
                          charging towards it, trips it during the chase and bites its throat to suffocate it to death. It breeds throughout the year.
                           After a gestation of nearly three months, females give birth to a litter of three or four cubs.
                         Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to predation by other large carnivores. They are weaned at around four months and are independent by around 20 months of age.</p>   </td>

                        flee when threatened but also bite and kick. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living
                         in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while
                          Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds.</p> <p> In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, 
                          while male Grévy's zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is polygynandrous.

                         in the monkey ("singes") group is the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).[3] Some nine million years before the divergence
                          between the Cercopithecidae and the apes,[6] the Platyrrhini emerged within "monkeys" by migration to South America 
                          from Afro-Arabia (the Old World),[citation needed][7][8] likely by ocean.[9][10][better source needed] Apes are

                        such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central 
                        Pacific oceans.[4] Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans. Around thirty families are 
                        currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera and about more than 4,170 species.[5] They range in size 
                        from the tiny, 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake[6] to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length.[7] The fossil 
                        species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long.[8] Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards,
                         perhaps during the Jurassic period, with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167 Ma ago.[9][10] The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the 
                        Paleocene epoch (c. 66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.  </td>
